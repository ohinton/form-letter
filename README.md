# A Letter to You

#### By Olivia Hinton & Neva Wood | Date: June 1, 2016

## Project Guidelines

Make a form letter where the user inputs their name, and they get back a letter addressed to them. Feel free to use lorum ipsum for the text of the letter. Use Bootstrap and your knowledge of CSS to make the letter look like a letter.
